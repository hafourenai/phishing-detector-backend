# Phishing Website Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting phishing websites based on URL features.

## Overview
The model is built using a public phishing dataset from Kaggle and implemented through a Google Collab. The approach focuses on supervised learning to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle:  
**Phishing Website Detector Dataset** by Eswarchand T  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eswarchandt/phishing-website-detector

## Implementation
The implementation is adapted from the following Kaggle Notebook:  
**Phishing URL Detection** by Hasibur Rahman  
https://www.kaggle.com/code/hasibur013/phishing-url-detection

Several minor adjustments were made to the notebook, including preprocessing steps, feature handling, and model configuration, to better fit this project’s structure and experimentation needs.
